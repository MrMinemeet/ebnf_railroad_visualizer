# EBNF Railroad Diagram Visualizer
A client-side browser-based tool for visualizing EBNF grammars as railroad diagrams.
Uses the [Wirth Syntax Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth_syntax_notation) (*WSN*) for EBNF, as this is the common format used by the [Institute for System Software](https://ssw.jku.at/) (SSW) at Johannes Kepler University.

This project is a part of the course [Project in Software Engineering](https://ssw.jku.at/Teaching/Lectures/PSE/2024SS/index.html) at the SSW and is supervised by [Dr. Markus Weninger](https://ssw.jku.at/General/Staff/Weninger/).

## Usage
The grammar expects a correctly formatted EBNF grammar in WSN. Uppercase identifiers are treated as Non-Terminal Symbols (*NTS*). Lowercase identifiers are treated as Terminal Symbols (*TS*) which cannot be broken down further, e.g. `an` which may stand for a-z, A-Z and 0-9.

The grammar is automatically parsed and visualized as a railroad diagram when an input is detected. Errors are displayed below the input grammar if any occur.

## Example
The following input results in the railroad diagram below:
```ebnf
Path = Dir { Dir } Name .
Dir = ( Name | "." [ "." ] ) "/" .
Name = an { an } .
```

## Features
* **Error Information:** In the case that an error occurs during scanning or parsing of the input grammar, a small description is written below the grammar as shown:

* **NTS Expansion:** NTS are displayed as rectangles and can be expanded by clicking them. The definition of the NTS is then displayed in a dashed box as shown:

* **URL Encoded Grammar:** Grammar is base64URL encoded into the URL. This allows for easy sharing of the current grammar by copying the URL or bookmarking it. The encoding also includes the list of expanded NTS.  
The URL encoding also utilizes `lz-string` to compress the grammar in order to reduce the length of the URL. A size comparison was perfomred on the grammar for [MicroJava](https://www.ssw.jku.at/Misc/CC/Handouts.pdf) with the following results (character count):

|Grammar|URL Encoded|Base64 Encoded|lz-string Compressed Base64|
|-------|-----------|--------------|---------------------------|
|   1241|       2305|          1656|                        916|
|   100%|     185,7%|        133.4%|                      73,8%|

This only includes the grammar length, not the encoded expands. 
## TODOs
* Make UI nicer and a bit more user-friendly. Maybe also add some instructions and a dark mode ðŸŒ•
